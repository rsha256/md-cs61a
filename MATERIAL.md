# Materials in This Guide
The course itself is pretty dense in terms of material covered, but this guide will attempt to eventually cover everything *and more*. The goal is to start from Week 0, where we'll go over the important basics taught in CS 10 (a pre-intro course at Berkeley) before diving into the 61A material. We'll also close off with a transition to 61B, and there may or may not be a separate guide for that class later on :)
